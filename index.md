## Overview

The Challenge:

For many UHM students the gym can seem like an intimidating place and going alone can feel daunting. It's not just about the lack of motivation but also the uncertainty about how to use the equipment effectively and the idea of taking on a new venture alone.

Our Solution:

On our app Manoa Fit Connect, we're all about making fitness fun, accessible, and supportive for every student. We've created a platform that connects you with gym buddies and provides the knowledge you need to feel confident in the gym environment.
